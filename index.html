                            I enjoy the running lifestyle, from training daily to trying out new engery
                            chews. I've ran two half marathons, one on a trail and another at the Flying Pig 
                            in Cincinnati. Next up: one more half, then the full!

                            There's nothing quite like hitting the creek and tracking down some monsters. 
                            My primary targets are small and large mouth bass, with the occasional northern 
                            pike or crappie. I prefer fishing in creeks because it adds an extra thrill to 
                            the adventure (totally not because I don't have a boat).

                            I've created several video games, both as class projects and for my own enjoyment. 
                            I've made a retro-style asteroid game and a Mario-like platformer, which were both 
                            exciting and challenging to develop. I've used Python, C++, and Godot for these 
                            projects, and I enjoy the blend of creativity and problem-solving that game development 
                            requires.

                        <h1>Internet Protocol</h1>
                        <p>
                            Using Python and our imagination, my friend and I crafted an internet 
                            protocol. Utilizing TCP, we sent data packets, ACKs, and NACKs. To 
                            demonstrate our protocol, we created a video game called "Plant Protocol."
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            When the player starts the game, they are prompted with a login screen. 
                            From there, our protocol manages communication between the client and 
                            server. After the user logs in, the client sends a communication to the 
                            server with the player's username. The server then responds by sending 
                            the client the player's plants and other relevant information.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            At the end of the session, the client sends the server an updated version 
                            of the plant list and other information, such as hunger and thirst levels. 
                            Through this project, I learned how to set up server and client 
                            communications as well as multithreading.

                        <h1>Pulse Width Modulation Motor Controller</h1>
                        
                        <div class="image-container-one-pic">

                        </div>
                        
                        <p>
                            I built a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) motor controller, 
                            a crucial component for managing motor speed and efficiency. This controller 
                            utilizes a 555 timer IC to generate the PWM signal, allowing for precise control 
                            over the duty cycle. A potentiometer adjusts this duty cycle, which directly 
                            influences the motor's performance. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            By integrating resistors and capacitors, I ensured stable signal processing and 
                            smooth operation. The MOSFET acts as a high-speed switch, enabling accurate 
                            regulation of the power delivered to the motor. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            This setup allows for fine-tuning of motor speed with high efficiency and minimal 
                            energy loss, highlighting a blend of practical electronics, hands-on engineering 
                            skills, and effective use of the 555 timer IC.

                        <p>
                            Using a two-stage operational amplifier, an infrared LED, some robust resistors, 
                            and the university's finest lab equipment, I created an operational heart 
                            rate monitoring system. The system is designed to power an LED when the oxygen 
                            levels in the blood are sufficiently high.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The infrared LED transmitter and receiver detect the heart rate signal, which 
                            is then fed through a two-stage amplifier. This amplification process boosts 
                            the signal from millivolts to volts. Once amplified, the signal powers an LED, 
                            indicating to the user that their heart is beating.
